And if that didn't convince you then:

This is a python program for analyzing meme usage on reddit's me_irl subreddit and creating relevent memes for posting

For more information and installation guides please check the meirlbot [wiki](https://github.com/tmoon8730/meirlbot/wiki/Java-Rewrite)

## Feature Roadmap
This project started from a simple goal of figuring out how to download spicy memes from meirl. It has now grown to a much larger project with new ideas and sub projects added all the time. The plan for meirlbot as of 10/25/2016 is as follows:

~~1. Finish MemeCreator Bot~~

~~2. Create MemeTrend Bot~~
 
~~3. Integrate meirlbot project in with the [MemeExchange](https://github.com/tmoon8730/MemeExchange) project~~

UPDATE:
New direction for the meirlbot (11/15/2016):

Looking into re-writing the meirlbot into a Java Spring AMQP Webapp. Using Python for a growing project is just causing more issues than it is worth and having to run a Meteor, Rabbitmq, and Flask servers simultaionously is getting out of hand.
