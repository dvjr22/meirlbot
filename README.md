And if that didn't convince you then:

This is a python program for analyzing meme usage on reddit's me_irl subreddit and creating relevent memes for posting

## Wiki
For more information and installation guides please check the meirlbot [wiki](https://github.com/tmoon8730/meirlbot/wiki)

## Feature Roadmap
This project started from a simple goal of figuring out how to download spicy memes from meirl. It has now grown to a much larger project with new ideas and sub projects added all the time. The plan for meirlbot as of 10/25/2016 is as follows:

1. Finish MemeCreator Bot

2. Create MemeTrend Bot
 
3. Integrate meirlbot project in with the [MemeExchange](https://github.com/tmoon8730/MemeExchange) project
