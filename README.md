And if that didn't convince you then:

This is a python program for analyzing meme usage on reddit's me_irl subreddit and creating relevent memes for posting

## Installation
* Clone this repo
* Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS variable to the path to the JSON file from the previous step
* Make sure there are read and write privileges to the images and createdMemes directory
* Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the python libraries needed
* Setup a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database
* Setup a [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html) messaging server
* Run "mongod" to start an instance of the database
* Run "rabbitmq-server start" to start the messaging server

Currently there is no clean way of starting the components of the project as they are still being developed. There are two components which need to be running to start any other components. Those are:
* Run "python MongoDBDatabase.py" from the MongoDB directory
* Run "python logFileWriter.py" from the LogWriter directory

These two components wait for RabbitMQ messages to write log files and update the database.

From here you can run any of the other components by using

* Run "python {component name}.py"


## Project Pieces
There are three main parts to the project as well as several utility parts

### MemeCreator Bot
  The purpose of the MemeCreator Bot is to generate new spicy memes. Using a MongoDB database with memes that have been found by the MemeTrend Bot to be new hot memes, the MemeCreator Bot attempts to create a new meme using a similar image and caption and then post that meme to the me_irl subreddit. This project is a work in progress and has new features planned faster than the original plan can be completed. The MemeCreator Bot is primarily written in Python and currently is started by a Bash Script.

### MemeTrend Bot
  The purpose of the MemeTrend Bot is to continually check me_irl's new page and try to determine if a new meme will become popular. When a meme is found then the redditId and the current upvote total is saved to the MongoDB database and the MemeCreator Bot is started.

### MemeExchange Website
The purpose of the MemeExchange website is to display the created memes as well as the current trends. It serves as the only GUI for the project. In the future user interaction pieces could be added. Also a admin panel will be added for allowing remote checking of system status's as well as changing the system parameters.



### Run Bot
* Use the following command to start the project
  - ./zMeIrlBot <reddit subreddit name>

### Explanation of Bot Parts
MEIRLBOT is split into five different parts with each part using a different technology. The majority of the project is written in the Python scripting language with a bash script to start it all.

| Part Name       | File Name     | Use                              | Main Technology       | Language       |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Reddit Downloader| redditDownloader.py| Downloads images from posts specified in the MongoDB database | [PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) | Python  |
| Keyword Gatherer | keywordGatherer.py | Determines caption of each image where the updateFlag in the database is set to true | [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) | Python |
| Google Downloader | googleDownloader.py | Scrapes Google Images using the caption to get a similar image to the meme | [GoogleImageCrawler](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/icrawler/0.2.2) | Python |
| Meme Creator | memeCreator.py | Creates the meme from the keywords and the images | [PIL (Python Image Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)) | Python |
| Reddit Uploader | redditPost.skl | Takes control of the mouse and uses image recognition to navigate to Reddit and upload the meme due to no upload ability in PRAW | [SikuliX](http://www.sikulix.com/) | Sikuli (Using Python) |


### MongoDB Schema
This project stores data in a MongoDB nonrelational database. There is one database called "meirlbot_mongodb" and one collection called "redditposts". The data in the redditposts collection is stored as JSON data with each reddit post following the schema:
```JSON
{
  "url": "<The url of the image>",
  "upvotes": "<The number of upvotes as of the last time it was checked>",
  "redditId": "<Id of the specific post which makes it easy to look up the post using [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable)>",
  "updateFlag": "<Set to true if the image is going to be used as a base for a meme. Only true if there is more upvotes currently then there is in the upvotes field in the database>",
  "captionText": "<The caption as determined via the Google Vision API OCR>",
  "localFile": "<Path to the downloaded meme>",
  "createdMemeFile": "<Path to the created meme>",
  "createdMemeFlag": "<True if a meme has been created with this post or false if it has not>"
}
```

## MemeTrend Bot
The purpose of the MemeTrend Bot is to continually check me_irl's new page and try to determine if a new meme will become popular. When a meme is found then the redditId and the current upvote total is saved to the MongoDB database and the MemeCreator Bot is started.

### Installation
There is not installation needed currently for the MemeTrend Bot. Simply pull down the code and run the start command which is specified in the next section

### Run Bot
* Use the following command to start the MemeTrend Bot (Note. This project will continue to run at a 5 min interval until the ctl-c KeyboardInterrupt command is issued)
  - python upvoteChecker.py

### Explanation of Bot Parts
This bot multi-threads two different parts. One part is the loadFromReddit method which pulls upvote information from me_irl's new page. The second part is the checkDatabase method which checks all the posts in the upvoteposts collection for a change in upvotes.

## Feature Roadmap
This project started from a simple goal of figuring out how to download spicy memes from meirl. It has now grown to a much larger project with new ideas and sub projects added all the time. The plan for meirlbot as of 10/25/2016 is as follows:

1. Finish MemeCreator Bot

2. Create MemeTrend Bot

3. Integrate meirlbot project in with the [MemeExchange](https://github.com/tmoon8730/MemeExchange) project
