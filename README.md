And if that didn't convince you then:

This is a python program for analyzing meme usage on reddit's me_irl subreddit and creating relevent memes for posting

## MemeCreator Bot
The purpose of the MemeCreator Bot is to generate new spicy memes. Using a MongoDB database with memes that have been found by the MemeTrend Bot to be new hot memes, the MemeCreator Bot attempts to create a new meme using a similar image and caption and then post that meme to the me_irl subreddit. This project is a work in progress and has new features planned faster than the original plan can be completed. The MemeCreator Bot is primarily written in Python and currently is started by a Bash Script.

### Installation
* Clone this repo
* Setup a Google Vision Credentials
* Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS variable to the path to the JSON file from the previous step
* Make sure there are read and write privileges to the images and createdMemes directory
* Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the python libraries needed
* Setup a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database
* Run "mongod" to start an instance of the database
* Run "./zMeIrlBot" from the MemeCreator directory to start the MemeCreator bot

### Run Project
* Use the following command to start the project
  - ./zMeIrlBot <reddit subreddit name>

### Explanation of Project Parts
MEIRLBOT is split into five different parts with each part using a different technology. The majority of the project is written in the Python scripting language with a bash script to start it all. 

| Part Name       | File Name     | Use                              | Main Technology       | Language       |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Reddit Downloader| redditDownloader.py| Downloads images from posts specified in the MongoDB database | [PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) | Python  |
| Keyword Gatherer | keywordGatherer.py | Determines caption of each image where the updateFlag in the database is set to true | [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) | Python |
| Google Downloader | googleDownloader.py | Scrapes Google Images using the caption to get a similar image to the meme | [GoogleImageCrawler](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/icrawler/0.2.2) | Python |
| Meme Creator | memeCreator.py | Creates the meme from the keywords and the images | [PIL (Python Image Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)) | Python |
| Reddit Uploader | redditPost.skl | Takes control of the mouse and uses image recognition to navigate to Reddit and upload the meme due to no upload ability in PRAW | [SikuliX](http://www.sikulix.com/) | Sikuli (Using Python) |


### MongoDB Schema
This project stores data in a MongoDB nonrelational database. There is one database called "meirlbot_mongodb" and one collection called "redditposts". The data in the redditposts collection is stored as JSON data with each reddit post following the schema:
```JSON
{
  "url": "<The url of the image>",
  "upvotes": "<The number of upvotes as of the last time it was checked>",
  "redditId": "<Id of the specific post which makes it easy to look up the post using [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable)>",
  "updateFlag": "<Set to true if the image is going to be used as a base for a meme. Only true if there is more upvotes currently then there is in the upvotes field in the database>",
  "captionText": "<The caption as determined via the Google Vision API OCR>",
  "localFile": "<Path to the downloaded meme>",
  "createdMemeFile": "<Path to the created meme>",
  "createdMemeFlag": "<True if a meme has been created with this post or false if it has not>"
}
```

## MemeTrend Bot
The purpose of the MemeTrend Bot is to continually check me_irl's new page and try to determine if a new meme will become popular. When a meme is found then the redditId and the current upvote total is saved to the MongoDB database and the MemeCreator Bot is started. Currently this bot is only theoretical and no work has been done on it as of yet. Great work is to come!

## Feature Roadmap
This project started from a simple goal of figuring out how to download spicy memes from meirl. It has now grown to a much larger project with new ideas and sub projects added all the time. The plan for meirlbot as of 10/25/2016 is as follows:

1. Finish MemeCreator Bot

  a. [Figure out file not found exceptions in the keywordGatherer.py file](https://github.com/tmoon8730/meirlbot/issues/12)
  
  b. [Determine why some generated memes turn into a weird trippy mess](https://github.com/tmoon8730/meirlbot/issues/13)
  
  c. [Cut the caption text by spaces to keep the words together](https://github.com/tmoon8730/meirlbot/issues/14)
  
  d. [Determine better value for the upvote exit condition](https://github.com/tmoon8730/meirlbot/issues/15)
  
2. Create MemeTrend Bot
 
  a. More details when the plan is solidified

3. Integrate meirlbot project in with the [MemeExchange](https://github.com/tmoon8730/MemeExchange) project
